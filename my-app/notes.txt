updated folder sructure -->
src -> app.js,index.js,index.css
public -> index.html,favicon,manifest
app.js --> import React from "react"; and import "./index.css";
index.js --> import react router dom by import {BrowserRouter} from "react-router-dom"
install react router dom by npm install react-router-dom

now instead of recatstrictmode  -->BrowserRouter in index.js
index.css consists of global css
